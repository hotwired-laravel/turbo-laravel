# Broadcasting Turbo Streams Over WebSockets With Laravel Echo

[TOC]

## Introduction

So far, we've seen how to generate Turbo Streams to either add it to our Blade views or return them from controllers after a form submission over HTTP. In addition to that, you may also broadcast model changes over WebSockets (or Server-Sent Events) to all users that are viewing the same page. Although nice, **you don't have to use WebSockets if you don't have the need for it. You may still benefit from Turbo Streams over HTTP.**

The key here is that we'd broadcast those exact same Turbo Stream tags we've seen before. Remember, "HTML over the wire." Turbo Stream Broadcasts use [Laravel Echo](https://github.com/laravel/echo) and [Laravel's Broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting) system.

Since broadcasts are commonly triggered after a form submission from one user, I'd still recommend feeding that specific user back with Turbo Streams (or a redirect and let Turbo refresh/morph) and only send the Turbo Stream broadcasts to _other_ users most of the time. This way, the user making the change will have an instant feedback compared to having to wait for a background worker to pick up the job and send it to them over WebSockets.

## Configuration

Broadcasting Turbo Streams relies heavily on [Laravel's Broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting)  component. This means you need to configure Laravel Echo in the frontend and either use [Pusher](https://pusher.com/) or any other open-source Pusher alternatives you may prefer. If you're not using Pusher, we recommend [Soketi](https://docs.soketi.app/) since it's easy to setup.

## Listening to Broadcasts

Turbo Laravel will publish a custom HTML tag to your application's `resources/js/elements` folder. This tag is called `<turbo-echo-stream-source>` (see [here](https://github.com/hotwired-laravel/turbo-laravel/blob/main/stubs/resources/js/elements/turbo-echo-stream-tag.js)).

You may add this tag to any Blade view passing the channel you want to listen to and users will start receiving Turbo Stream Broadcasts right away:

```blade
<turbo-echo-stream-source
    channel="App.Models.Post.{{ $post->id }}"
/>
```

For convenience, you may prefer using the `<x-turbo::stream-from>` Blade component that ships with Turbo Laravel (it requires that you have a custom element named `<turbo-echo-stream-source>` available, since that's the tag this component will render). You may pass the model as the `source` prop to it, it will figure out the channel name for that specific model using [Laravel's conventions](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting#model-broadcasting-conventions):

```blade
<x-turbo::stream-from :source="$post" />
```

By default, it expects a private channel, so it must be used in a page where users are already authenticated. You may control the channel type in the tag with a `type` attribute.

```blade
<x-turbo::stream-from :source="$post" type="public" />
```

Make sure you have the Broadcast Auth Route for your models registered in your `routes/channels.php` file:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Broadcast;

Broadcast::channel(Post::class, function (User $user, Post $post) {
    return $user->belongsToTeam($post->team);
});
```

You may want to read the [Laravel Broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting) documentation.

## Broadcasting Model Changes

To be broadcast model changes for a particular, you must add the `Broadcasts` trait to your models:

```php
use HotwiredLaravel\TurboLaravel\Models\Broadcasts;

class Comment extends Model
{
    use Broadcasts;
}
```

This trait will augment any model with Turbo Stream broadacsting methods that you may use to trigger broadcasts. Here's how you can broadcast an `append` Turbo Stream for a newly created comment to all users visiting the post page:

```php
Route::post('posts/{post}/comments', function (Post $post) {
    $comment = $post->comments()->create(/** params */);

    $comment->broadcastAppend()->toOthers()->later();

    if (request()->wantsTurboStream()) {
        return turbo_stream($comment);
    }

    return back();
});
```

Here are the methods now available to your model:

```php
$comment->broadcastAppend();
$comment->broadcastPrepend();
$comment->broadcastBefore('target_dom_id');
$comment->broadcastAfter('target_dom_id');
$comment->broadcastReplace();
$comment->broadcastUpdate();
$comment->broadcastRemove();
$comment->broadcastRefresh();
```

These methods will assume you want to broadcast to your model's channel. However, you may want to send these broadcasts to a related model's channel instead:

```php
$comment->broadcastAppendTo($post);
$comment->broadcastPrependTo($post);
$comment->broadcastBeforeTo($post, 'target_dom_id');
$comment->broadcastAfterTo($post, 'target_dom_id');
$comment->broadcastReplaceTo($post);
$comment->broadcastUpdateTo($post);
$comment->broadcastRemoveTo($post);
$comment->broadcastRefreshTo($post);
```

These `broadcastXTo()` methods accept either a model, an instance of the [`Channel`](https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/10.x/src/Illuminate/Broadcasting/Channel.php) class, or an array containing both of these. When it receives a model, it will guess the channel name using Laravel's [Broadcasting channel naming convention](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting#model-broadcasting-conventions).

All of these broadcasting methods return an instance of the `PendingBroadcast` class that will only dispatch the broadcasting job when that pending object is being garbage collected. Which means you may make changes to this pending broadcast by chaining on the returned object:

```php
$comment->broadcastAppend()
    ->to($post)
    ->view('comments/_custom_view_partial', [
        'comment' => $comment,
        'post' => $post,
    ])
    ->toOthers() // Do not send to the current user...
    ->later(); // Don't send it now, dispatch a job to send in background instead...
```

You may want to hook these broadcasts from your [model's events](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/eloquent#events) to trigger Turbo Stream broadcasts whenever your models are changed in any context:

```php
class Comment extends Model
{
    use Broadcasts;

    protected static function booted()
    {
        static::created(function (Comment $comment) {
            $comment->broadcastPrependTo($comment->post)->later();
        });

        static::updated(function (Comment $comment) {
            $comment->broadcastReplaceTo($comment->post)->later();
        });

        static::deleted(function (Comment $comment) {
            $comment->broadcastRemoveTo($comment->post)->later();
        });
    }
}
```

For convenience, instead of adding all these lines to achieve this set of broadcasting, you may add a `$broadcasts = true` property to your model class. This property instructs the `Brodcasts` trait to automatically hook the model Tubro Stram broadcasts on the correct events:

```php
class Comment extends Model
{
    use Broadcasts;

    protected $broadcasts = true;
}
```

This achieves almost the same set of Broadcasts as the previous example, with a few nuanced differences. First, by default, it will broadcast an `append` Turbo Stream on newly created models. You may want to use `prepend` instead. You may do that by changing the `$broadcasts` property to be a configuration array instead of a boolean `true`, then set the `insertsBy` key to `prepend`:

```php
class Comment extends Model
{
    use Broadcasts;

    protected $broadcasts = [
        'insertsBy' => 'prepend',
    ];
}
```

When using the `$broadcasts` property, the Turbo Stream broadcasts will be sent to the current model's channel. However, since the channels use the model's ID as per the naming convention, no one will ever be able to listen on that channel before the model is created. For that reason, Turbo Stream broadcasts of newly created models will be sent to a private channel using the model's plural name instead. You may also configure which `stream` name this specific Turbo Stream should be sent to by setting the `stream` key on the `$broadcasts` property:

```php
class Comment extends Model
{
    use Broadcasts;

    protected $broadcasts = [
        'insertsBy' => 'prepend',
        'stream' => 'my-comments',
    ];
}
```

This will send the Turbo Stream broadcast to private channel called `my-comments` when a new comment is created.

Alternatively, you may also set a `$broadcastsTo` proprety with either a string with the name of the relationship to be used to resolve the channel, or an array of relationships if you want to send the broadcast to multiple related model's channels:

```php
class Comment extends Model
{
    use Broadcasts;

    protected $broadcasts = [
        'insertsBy' => 'prepend',
    ];

    protected $broadcastsTo = 'post';

    public function post()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Post::class);
    }
}
```

You may also do that by adding a `broadcastsTo()` method to your model instead of the `$broadcastsTo` property. The method must return either an Eloquent model, a Channel instance, or an array with a mix of those:

```php
use Illuminate\Broadcasting\Channel;

class Comment extends Model
{
    use Broadcasts;

    protected $broadcasts = [
        'insertsBy' => 'prepend',
    ];

    public function post()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Post::class);
    }

    public function broadcastsTo()
    {
        return [
            $this,
            $this->post,
            new Channel('full-control'),
        ];
    }
}
```

Having a `$broadcastsTo` property or implementing the `broadcastsTo()` method in your model will have precedence over the `stream` key of the `$broadcasts` property.

## Broadcasting Page Refreshes

Similar to the `$broadcasts` property, you may want to automatically configure page refresh broadcasts on a modal. You may use the `$broadcastsRefreshes` property for that:

```php
use Illuminate\Broadcasting\Channel;

class Comment extends Model
{
    use Broadcasts;

    protected $broadcastsRefreshes = true;
}
```

This is the same as doing:

```php
use Illuminate\Broadcasting\Channel;

class Comment extends Model
{
    use Broadcasts;

    public static function booted()
    {
        static::created(function ($comment) {
            $comment->broadcastRefreshTo("comments")->later();
        });

        static::updated(function ($comment) {
            $comment->broadcastRefresh()->later();
        });

        static::deleted(function ($comment) {
            $comment->broadcastRefresh();
        });
    }
}
```

You may want to broadcast page refreshes to a related model:

```php
use Illuminate\Broadcasting\Channel;

class Comment extends Model
{
    use Broadcasts;

    protected $broadcastsRefreshes = true;

    protected $broadcastsRefreshesTo = ['post'];

    public function post()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Post::class);
    }
}
```

This will send page refreshes broadcasts to the related `Post` model channel.

Alternatively, you may specific a `broadcastsRefreshesTo` method instead of a property:

```php
use Illuminate\Broadcasting\Channel;

class Comment extends Model
{
    use Broadcasts;

    protected $broadcastsRefreshes = true;

    public function post()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Post::class);
    }

    public function broadcastsRefreshesTo()
    {
        return [$this->post];
    }
}
```

From this method, you may return an instance of an Eloquent model, a string representing the channel name, or an instance of a `Channel` class.

## Broadcasting Turbo Streams to Other Users Only

As mentioned erlier, you may want to feed the current user with Turbo Streams using HTTP requests and only send the broadcasts to other users. You may achieve that by chaining on the pending broadcast object that returns from all `broadcastX` methods:

```php
$comment->broadcastAppendTo($post)->toOthers();
```

Alternatively, you may use the Turbo Facade like so to configure a scope where all brodcasted Turbo Streams will be sent to other users only:

```php
use HotwiredLaravel\TurboLaravel\Facades\Turbo;

Turbo::broadcastToOthers(function () {
    // ...
});
```

If you always want to send broadcasts to other users excluding the current user from receiving broadcasts, you may call the `broadcastToOthers` without passing a closure to it somewhere globally like a middleware or the `AppServiceProvider::boot()` method:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
use HotwiredLaravel\TurboLaravel\Facades\Turbo;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function boot()
    {
        Turbo::broadcastToOthers();
    }
}
```

This only applies to broadcasts generated in an HTTP request, because this relies on having the `X-Socket-ID` header in the request, which Laravel Echo sets automatically. Any broadcast generate from a queue worker, for instance, will always be broadcasted to all users listening on the broadcasted channels.

## Handmade Broadcasts

You may want to broadcast something independently of a model. You may do so using the `HotwiredLaravel\TurboLaravel\Facades\TurboStream` Facade (if you're not into Facades, type-hinting the `HotwiredLaravel\TurboLaravel\Broadcasting\Factory` class should also work):

```php
TurboStream::broadcastAppend(
    content: __('Hello World'),
    target: 'notifications',
    channel: 'general',
);
```

Model broadcasts use this same abstraction under the hood, so you have similar methods available:

```php
TurboStream::broadcastAppend();
TurboStream::broadcastPrepend();
TurboStream::broadcastBefore();
TurboStream::broadcastAfter();
TurboStream::broadcastUpdate();
TurboStream::broadcastReplace();
TurboStream::broadcastRemove();
TurboStream::broadcastRefresh();
```

All of these methods, except the `broadcastRemove()` and `broadcastRefresh`, accept a `$content` parameter that may be a View instance, an instance of the `HtmlString` class, or a simple string:

```php
// Passing a view instance as content...
TurboStream::broadcastAppend(
    content: view('layouts.notification', ['message' => 'Hello World']),
    target: 'notifications',
    channel: 'general',
);

// Passing an instance of the HtmlString class (won't be escaped by Blade)...
TurboStream::broadcastAppend(
    content: new HtmlString('Hello World'),
    target: 'notifications',
    channel: 'general',
);

// Passing a simple string (will be escaped by Blade)...
TurboStream::broadcastAppend(
    content: 'Hello World',
    target: 'notifications',
    channel: 'general',
);
```

You may also customize the Turbo Stream by chaining on the returned `PendingBroadcast` object:

```php
TurboStream::broadcastAppend('Hello World')
    ->target('notifications')
    ->to('general');
```

As for the channel, you may pass a string that will be interpreted as a public channel name, an Eloquent model which will resolve to a private channel using that model's broadcasting channel convention, or instances of the `Illuminate\Broadcasting\Channel` class.

You may want to specify private or presence string channels instead of public ones:

```php
TurboStream::broadcastAppend('Hello World')
    ->target('notifications')
    ->toPrivateChannel('user.123');

TurboStream::broadcastAppend('Hello World')
    ->target('notifications')
    ->toPresenceChannel('user.123');
```

Using the `broadcastAction()` will allow you to broadcast any custom Turbo Stream action, so you're not limited to the default ones when using this approach:

```php
TurboStream::broadcastAction('scroll_to', target: 'todo_123');
```

## Handmade Broadcasting Using The `turbo_stream()` Response Builder

One more alternative to broadcasting Turbo Streams is to call the `broadcastTo()` method on the returned object of the `turbo_stream()` function:

```php
turbo_stream()
    ->append('notifications', 'Hello World')
    ->broadcastTo('general');
```

This will tap on the `PendingTurboStreamResponse` and create a `PendingBroadcast` from it. It's important to note that this will return the same `PendingTurboStreamResponse`, not the `PendingBroadcast`. If you want to configure the `PendingBroadcast` that will be generated, you must do that before calling the `broadcastTo()` method, but you may also pass a `Closure` as the second parameter:

```php
turbo_stream()
    ->append('notifications', 'Hello World')
    ->broadcastTo('general', fn ($broadcast) => $broadcast->toOthers());
```

The first argument must be either a string, an Eloquent model, or an instance of the `Illuminate\Broadcasting\Channel` class as the channel:

```php
turbo_stream($comment)
    ->broadcastTo($comment->post, fn ($broadcast) => $broadcast->toOthers());
```

Similarly to using the Facade, you may also want to broadcast to private or presence string channels like so:

```php
// Broadcast to private channels...
turbo_stream()
    ->append('notifications', 'Hello World')
    ->broadcastToPrivateChannel('user.123', fn ($broadcast) => $broadcast->toOthers())

// Broadcast to presence channels...
turbo_stream()
    ->append('notifications', 'Hello World')
    ->broadcastToPresenceChannel('chat.123', fn ($broadcast) => $broadcast->toOthers());
```
